# 3DModels
3D Models using IC3D for a grocery store VR application.

To view the files open a rescpective folder and download/view the .dae file. Depending on your OS you will be able to view the 3D model. The IC3D raw files and the PDF labels are included. 
There is a small issue with the yogurt model labels not correctly placed on the models causing a skew making parts of the label unreadable. 

If using these models in your own projects please reference this github.
